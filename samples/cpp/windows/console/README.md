# C++ Console app for Windows

This sample demonstrates various forms of speech recognition, intent recognition, conversation transcription and translation using the Speech SDK for C++ on Windows.

> **Note:**
> Conversation Transcription is in [Preview](https://aka.ms/cts/ctsoverview). The
> ConversationTranscriber APIs are subjected to change. It requires
> multi-microphone devices that can be paired with [Cognitive Services Speech
> Device SDK](https://aka.ms/cts/getsdk).

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key and region for the Speech service [Create one for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/cognitive-services/)
* [Create a Speech resource](https://ms.portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServicesSpeechServices) in the Azure portal.
* Get the resource key and region. After your Speech resource is deployed, select Go to resource to view and manage keys. or  more information about Cognitive Services resources, see [Get the keys for your resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/cognitive-services-apis-create-account?tabs=multiservice%2Cwindows#get-the-keys-for-your-resource)
* A PC (Windows x64 or a supported Linux distribution) or Mac (macOS 10.14 or later) capable to run Eclipse,[<sup>[1]</sup>](#footnote1) with a working speaker.
* A Windows PC; some sample scenarios require a working microphone.
* [Microsoft Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/), Community Edition or higher.
* The **Desktop development with C++** workload in Visual Studio and the **NuGet package manager** component in Visual Studio.
  You can enable both in **Tools** \> **Get Tools and Features**, under the **Workloads** and **Individual components** tabs, respectively.

## Build the sample

* **By building this sample you will download the Microsoft Cognitive Services Speech SDK. By downloading you acknowledge its license, see [Speech SDK license agreement](https://aka.ms/csspeech/license201809).**
* [Download the sample code to your development PC.](/README.md#get-the-samples)
* Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
* Navigate to the folder containing this sample, and select the solution file contained within it.
* To tailor the sample to your configuration, use search and replace across the whole solution (for example, via **Edit** \> **Find and Replace** \> **Quick Replace**) to update the following strings:

  * `YourSubscriptionKey`: replace with your subscription key.
  * `YourServiceRegion`: replace with the [region](https://aka.ms/csspeech/region) your subscription is associated with.
    For example, `westus` or `northeurope`.
  * `YourEndpointId` (optional): replace with the endpoint ID of your customized model in [CRIS](https://cris.ai).
  * The following settings apply for intent recognition powered by the [Language Understanding service (LUIS)](https://aka.ms/csspeech/luisdocs):
    * `YourLanguageUnderstandingSubscriptionKey`: replace with your Language Understanding service subscription key (endpoint key).
    * `YourLanguageUnderstandingServiceRegion`: replace with the region associated with your Language Understanding service subscription.
    * `YourLanguageUnderstandingAppId`: replace with the ID of a Language Understanding service application that you want to recognize intents with.
    * `YourLanguageUnderstandingIntentName1`, `YourLanguageUnderstandingIntentName2`, `YourLanguageUnderstandingIntentName3`: replace with names of intents that your Language Understanding service application recognizes.
  * The following settings apply to keyword-triggered recognition:
    * `YourKeywordRecognitionModelFile.table`: replace with the location of your keyword recognition model file.
    * `YourKeyword`: replace with the phrase your keyword recognition model triggers on.
* Set the active solution configuration and platform to the desired values under **Build** \> **Configuration Manager**:
  * On a 64-bit Windows installation, choose `x64` as active solution platform.
  * On a 32-bit Windows installation, choose `x86` as active solution platform.
* Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.

> **Note**
> If you are seeing red squigglies from IntelliSense for Speech SDK APIs,
> right-click into your editor window and select **Rescan** > **Rescan Solution** to resolve.

## Run the sample
